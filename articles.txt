The Shanxi Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology published inscriptions on Tuesday that were found on bronzewares unearthed at one of the ancient tombs of Beibaie village in Yuanqu county, Shanxi province.

Nearly 200 Chinese characters were carved on the lids and outside surfaces of the bronzewares.

Last April, a team including staff members from the provincial and local institutes of cultural relics and archaeology began a systematic excavation. They found nine large and medium-sized tombs from the Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC) to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC).

Hundreds of cultural relics, including bronzewares, pottery, jade lacquer wood, bonewares and stonewares, were unearthed at the site. In four of the tombs, staff members found bronzewares caved with inscriptions.

"The ethnicity of the tomb owner is unclear," said Yang Jiyun, a researcher at the provincial institute. "Based on the documents and the inscriptions, we have inferred the possibility it belonged to the State of Yan in late Western Zhou Dynasty."
One thousand students from a primary school in Ruyang, Henan province, gathered on Tuesday for calligraphy celebrating the upcoming centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Using pencil, pen and brush, the students wrote poems about the soldiers of the Long March and their inspirational spirit and lofty character.

Teachers from the Secondary Experimental Primary School of Ruyang county, Luoyang city, said the activity carried forward Chinese traditional culture and calligraphic art as students learned of the glorious history of the Communist Party of China.
